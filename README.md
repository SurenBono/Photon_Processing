# Photon_Processing

- Divides binary 1 into 255 ASCII by PWM Tech.
- Faster Processing Ideas with PWM.
- Since the Binary 01000001 = A , takes up 8 bit of proceess time, photon just take 1/8 bit to process.
- 1/255 PWM(HIGH) is = A or 255/1 bit .
- While current computer is processing the letter "A" photon processing had made up a full word .
- There is countless numbers in Analog read/write on higer resolutions (32bit/64bit/128bit..etc.).
- Faster than a morse code.
- Program derived from fade sketch.
